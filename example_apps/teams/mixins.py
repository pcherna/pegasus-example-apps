# apps/teams/mixins.py

# To make a model team-specific:
# - Add the TeamModelMixin to your model class
# - In your model, add a get_absolute_url() that adds the team slug, e.g.:
#    def get_absolute_url(self):
#        return reverse('appname:model-detailview', kwargs={'team_slug': self.team.slug, 'pk': self.pk})
# To make the views for a team-specific model:
# - Add the LoginAndTeamRequiredMixin or TeamAdminRequiredMixin to each view class
# - In the delete-view, add a get_success_url() method which includes
#       kwargs={'team_slug': self.request.team.slug}
# - Update all references to your views to include the team slug as the first argument
